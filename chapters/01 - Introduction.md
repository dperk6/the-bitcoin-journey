# INTRODUCTION

On October 31, 2008, a software developer using the pseudonym _Satoshi Nakamoto_ announced on _The Cryptography Mailing List_ that they had been working on "a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party". Satoshi provided a link to a whitepaper titled _Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System_ which provided the full details of the solution.<sup>1</sup> In this paper, Satoshi proved that they had created a novel solution to a longstanding distributed systems' problem.

Satoshi Nakamoto's solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem, as it is known, allows for parties that do not trust each other to agree on a set of records in a network with no central authority. While that may sound abstract, think of it like this: all forms of money in the world today rely on a central authority - a bank, government, or corporation - to maintain the master ledger and determine who owns what. That requires an incredible amount of trust in that central authority, and human history is full of situations in which governments, banks, and corporations have abused that trust for their own gain.

On January 3, 2009, the Bitcoin network officially launched. The true story of Bitcoin, however, started long before that.

Cryptographers, software developers and engineers, libertarians and anarchists, gold bugs, and futurists converged in a social group referred to as cypherpunks who sought to create a native digital currency for the internet beyond the controls of any central authorities. A truly free market currency for use in a free and open internet. Previous attempts such as Bmoney, digicash, bit gold, and other schemes were concocted, each of them solving one challenge or another before running into limitations or dying off, often due to regulatory concerns and government intervention.

This paper will show that the path to a functional decentralized digital currency was long and frought with failures, and that Bitcoin is a culmination of decades of effort and research on the subject. Bitcoin was the spark of the revolution, but it was not developed in a vaccuum. It is a brilliant culmination of all the work done prior with an astonishing amount of thought put into the challenges that each system did overcome, and the challenges and limitations that the previous systems could not overcome. Satoshi sought to understand why the previous digital currency systems failed and how to fix them, while taking inspiration from other sources as well, such as BitTorrent. From its core architecture, Bitcoin is designed to be resistant to virtually every threat that malicious actors could throw at it, through a combination of data distribution, cryptographic proofs, economic game theory, and individual incentives.

So what work exactly did Satoshi Nakamoto leverage to create Bitcoin? How far has Bitcoin come since the Financial Times' headline from January 3, 2009 was inscribed into the first block of transactions, _mined_ by Satoshi? We are now 13 years into Bitcoin's history. Has it matched or exceeded the potential of its promises? Has it failed? What new challenges do we find with decentralized currencies after the past decade with Bitcoin? This book will seek to answer those questions as best as possible, highlight the good, the bad, and the ongoing challenges facing Bitcoin in its quest to become a true world currency protected against manipulation and corruption.

> A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990s. I hope it's obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them.

-- Satoshi Nakamoto (February 15, 2009)<sup>2</sup>
