# The Bitcoin Journey

## Intro

Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology, which many believe is an invention of societal important on the level of the Internet, radio, and the combustion engine. It will take many years before we can judge this, but one thing is for sure: the Bitcoin mission and the Bitcoin story started long before Satoshi Nakamoto's first mailing list post on Halloween 2008.

The Bitcoin Journey is an open source, long-form essay discussing the development of Bitcoin. Bitcoin represents a major breakthrough in research and development that had been brewing since the 70s and 80s. Satoshi Nakamoto found solutions to technical (and social) challenges that doomed the previous attempts.

## What does it cover?

This essay will **not** attempt to convince you of the importance of Bitcoin. As Satoshi said, "If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.".

This essay **will** show readers that the quest for decentralized digital money was a long process. It will highlight the previous efforts. It will discuss the motivations. And it will explain how we ended up where we are today.

## Contributing to the story

As an open source project, you can submit a pull request with your edits. But there are rules. If you don't like the rules, you can fork the entire repo or copy/paste the parts that you like and remove what you don't. I would appreciate credit but I don't really care.

Here are the rules:  
- Other than a general assumption that Bitcoin is good and freedom is necessary, there are **no** explicit politics allowed.
- The scaling debate got quite heated, ultimately culminating in the BTC-BCH chain split. I have tried very hard to present each side of the debate fairly. There are many valid points on each side of the debate, please respect that fact.
- Related to the point above, this essay **will** focus on Bitcoin itself, not Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV. Please do not make contributions that focus unnecessarily on other networks unless it is in relation to the scaling debate and how it all played out.
- Likewise, we will discuss other blockchain networks _only_ from the perspective of the Bitcoin development process. If you are a Bitcoin maximalist, or a fan of Namecoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, or Ethereum, please do not express as much in your contributions.
- This essay will not speculate about Satoshi Nakamoto's identity. Please don't focus on it in any contributions. It is of no importance beyond the intrigue. There is plenty of literature about that elsewhere if you are so inclined.
